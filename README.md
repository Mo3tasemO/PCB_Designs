# PCB_Designs

Collection of my personal **PCB projects**, breakouts, development boards, and small electronics designs — mostly created in **KiCad**.

Currently includes:

- Breadboard-friendly linear / switching power supplies
- ESP8266 / ESP-12 based development/breakout boards
- Simple function/signal generators
- Various utility/test circuits

## ⚡ Want to build something?

1. Open the folder of the project you like
2. Open the `.kicad_pro` file in KiCad
3. Plot Gerbers / Drill files yourself or use the existing `gerbers/` / `production/` folder (if present)
4. Order from your favorite PCB fab 😄

**Warning:** Most designs here are **not production-tested** yet. You can use it at your own risk.
